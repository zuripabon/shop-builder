Agenda:

    1. Run server and run specs, server port will collide
    2. Use server port 0 to allocate random and use the address to print it
    3. The test arranger is not well designed as it exposes info it should not
       only exposing that info in order to make the test work
    4. Fix the test arranger so it only is responsible for setting up/down the environment
    5. To do so, we need to convert our http application into a singleton which
    in turn makes total sense as we do not want to allow, and this, by design, 
    anyone to instantiate more than one http app
    6. Finally, let's learn a bit about servers in nodejs and sockets, we could actually use
    a socket instead of random port for tests. Yes, we can have a HTTP server without opening any port

    In the HttpApp:

    this.httpServer = await this.app.listen(
      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test' ? '/tmp/testing-socket' : port
    );

    In the products.steps.ts
    httpResponse = await request(
      `http+unix://${encodeURIComponent('/tmp/testing-socket')}`
    )
      .post(route)
      .send(JSON.parse(payload));
